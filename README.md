# Helpful Scripts

A collection of practical scripts I use for development, DevOps, system administration, and general automation. These scripts help streamline daily tasks, speed up environment setup, and remove repetitive manual steps across Linux and Windows.

## 📦 What's Inside

This repository includes scripts for:

- **System automation**  
  Updates, installs, cleanup tasks, environment prep

- **Developer tooling**  
  Go version updater, Node/Bun helpers, project utilities

- **Networking & security**  
  Quick checks, connectivity tests, security helpers

- **Homelab & server workflows**  
  VM management, logs, monitoring tools

- **General utilities**  
  Small quality-of-life scripts I reach for often

More scripts get added as I automate new workflows.
